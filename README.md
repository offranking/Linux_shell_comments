Linux shell scripting comments

#### In Linux shell scripting, comments are lines in your script that the shell ignores when executing. They are used to add explanations, notes, or instructions within the code to make it easier to understand and maintain

* Start with the # symbol.
* Everything after # on that line is ignored by the shell.

# This is another way to create
# a multi-line comment. Each line
# is prefixed with a # symbol.
echo "Here is an actual code that gets executed"
